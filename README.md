# MPC-Cassie-Hovershoes
High level Model Predictive Controller for a bipedal robot riding hovershoes. Final project for Feedback Control of Legged Robots at UC Berkeley.

Included are the relevant files we developed for the project - namely the simplified model, CFTOC solver, and higher level MPC controller.
The lower level controller we interfaced with is private and owned by the Hybrid Robotics lab at UC Berkeley.
